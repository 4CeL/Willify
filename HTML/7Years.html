                    "7 Years" by Lukas Graham, released in 2015, is a reflective pop song that explores themes of growth, 
                    life experiences, and aspirations. With its poignant lyrics and soulful vocals, the song recounts the 
                    artist's journey from childhood to adulthood, looking ahead to future milestones.

            <p>
                Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me<br>
                "Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"<br>
                Once, I was seven years old<br><br>
                It was a big-big world, but we thought we were bigger<br>
                Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker<br>
                By 11, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor<br>
                Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure<br><br>
                Once, I was 11 years old, my daddy told me<br>
                "Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely"<br>
                Once, I was 11 years old<br><br>
                I always had that dream like my daddy before me<br>
                So I started writing songs, I started writing stories<br>
                Something about the glory just always seemed to bore me<br>
                'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me<br><br>
                Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told<br>
                Before the morning sun, when life was lonely<br>
                Once, I was 20 years old<br>
                (Lukas Graham!)<br><br>
                I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure<br>
                'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major<br>
                I got my boys with me, at least those in favor<br>
                And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later<br><br>
                Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told<br>
                I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me<br>
                Once, I was 20 years old<br><br>
                Soon, we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold<br>
                We've traveled around the world, and we're still roaming<br>
                Soon, we'll be 30 years old<br><br>
                I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me<br>
                So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories<br>
                Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory<br>
                And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry<br><br>
                Soon, I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61<br>
                Remember life and then your life becomes a better one<br>
                I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once<br>
                I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month<br><br>
                Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?<br>
                Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?<br>
                Soon, I'll be 60 years old<br><br>
                Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?<br>
                Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?<br>
                Soon, I'll be 60 years old<br><br>
                Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me<br>
                "Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"<br>
