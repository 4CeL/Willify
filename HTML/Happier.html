                    "Happier" by Marshmello is a poignant reflection on love and heartbreak. With its catchy beat and heartfelt lyrics, 
                    it explores the bittersweet emotions of longing and acceptance. The song acknowledges the desire for a former lover's 
                    happiness, even if it means moving on.

            <p>
                Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
                I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br><br>
                When the morning comes<br>
                When we see what we've become<br>
                In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind<br>
                Not the fire that we've begun<br>
                Every argument, every word we can't take back<br>
                'Cause with the all that has happened<br>
                I think that we both know the way that this story ends<br><br>
                Then only for a minute<br>
                I want to change my mind<br>
                'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br>
                I wanna raise your spirits<br>
                I want to see you smile but<br>
                Know that means I'll have to leave<br><br>
                Know that means I'll have to leave<br>
                Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
                I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br><br>
                When the evening falls<br>
                And I'm left there with my thoughts<br>
                And the image of you being with someone else<br>
                Well, it's eating me up inside<br>
                But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay<br>
                Now if we jump together at least we can swim<br>
                Far away from the wreck we made<br><br>
                Then only for a minute<br>
                I want to change my mind<br>
                'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br>
                I wanna raise your spirits<br>
                I want to see you smile but<br>
                Know that means I'll have to leave<br><br>
                Know that means I'll have to leave<br>
                Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
                I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br><br>
                So I'll go, I'll go<br>
                I will go, go, go<br>
                So I'll go, I'll go<br>
                I will go, go, go<br><br>
                Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
                I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br>
                Even though I might not like this<br>
                I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier<br><br>
                Then only for a minute (only for a minute)<br>
                I want to change my mind<br>
                'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br>
                I wanna raise your spirits (wanna raise your spirits)<br>
                I want to see you smile but<br>
