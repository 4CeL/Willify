            <p>
                You know me the best<br>
                You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge<br>
                That right there is the scariest feeling<br>
                Opening and closing up again<br>
                I've been hurt, so I don't trust<br>
                Now here we are, staring at the ceiling<br><br>
                I've said those words before, but it was a lie<br>
                And you deserve to hear them a thousand times<br><br>
                If all it is is eight letters<br>
                Why is it so hard to say?<br>
                If all it is is eight letters<br>
                Why am I in my own way?<br>
                Why do I pull you close?<br>
                And then ask you for space<br>
                If all it is is eight letters<br>
                Why is it so hard to say?<br><br>
                Isn't it amazing how almost every line on our hands align?<br>
                When your hand's in mine<br>
                It's like I'm whole again, isn't that a sign?<br>
                I should speak my mind<br><br>
                I've said those words before, but it was a lie<br>
                And you deserve to hear them a thousand times<br>
