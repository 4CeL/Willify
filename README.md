# Willify
Willify is a responsive web application I developed as an individual project for my Human-Computer Interaction class, designed to provide a streamlined interface for discovering music and viewing lyrics. As the sole developer, I managed the entire project lifecycle—from initial UI/UX design to front-end development—resulting in a fully functional application for users. The project's primary impact was successfully engineering a dynamic user experience from scratch, a process that significantly deepened my mastery of UI/UX principles and front-end programming with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was foundational in solidifying my ability to create rich, interactive websites using only the core technologies of the web.
